# Advent of Code 2021

This repository attempts at solving the daily puzzles which are a part of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 challenge.

I am using [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) in [Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)([Github](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive)) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is akin to using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for Python.

As this repo is not really ment to showcase the solutions, they may be mess and/or not very explanative.
